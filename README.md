# About

This repositories demonstrates the addition of new commands to the [edward][edward github] text editor.
The editor provides a Scheme [library interface][edward doc] through which new commands can be added.
Using this library interface, the following commands have been implemented in this repository:

1. A [ctags][ctags web] command which set the current address to a given tag.
2. An [fzf][fzf github] command for changing the current file.
3. A pipe command for filtering text using shell commands.
4. A scroll command which is provided by many BSD ed(1) implementations.

## Demonstration

![Recording of a terminal session which demonstrates the usage of an enhanced version of the Unix text editor ed(1). The editor is used to display the contents of a Scheme source code file. Within this editor session, a "z" (scroll), "T" (ctags), and "F" (fzf) command is used to navigate the source code.](https://gist.github.com/nmeum/3773eb8fb280d469e67711c5635416f6/raw/dc3afaed32bef4deec90cd18255ba9203c8ac155/edward-contrib.gif)
